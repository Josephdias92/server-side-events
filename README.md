# Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) in a web application. SSE allows servers to push real-time updates to clients over a single HTTP connection, making it an efficient way to send continuous data streams.

## What are Server-Sent Events (SSE)?

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard describing how servers can initiate data transmission towards browser clients once an initial client connection has been established. Unlike WebSockets, which allow for full-duplex communication, SSE is a one-way communication channel from the server to the client.

### Key Features of SSE:
- **Automatic Reconnection**: The browser will automatically reconnect if the connection is closed.
- **Event IDs**: The server can send an event ID to the client, which can be used to resume the connection from the last event received.
- **Simple API**: SSE uses a simple HTTP-based protocol, making it easy to implement and use.

### Use Cases for SSE:
- Real-time notifications
- Live score updates
- Social media feeds
- Monitoring dashboards
